This is my first project on github and R so pardon any omissions or errors.

I didn't find out where to put my attributions for the code that I used so I'll put them here for the while:

1. gSOAP
2. RapidXML


Installation

1. Open R (either RStudio, command line or other). Install Rcpp package. Exit from R.
   install.packages("Rcpp")
2. Clone github project or download prebuild binaries.
3. Build/Install X4R project.
   From Source: R CMD INSTALL X4R
   From Binary: R CMD INSTALL <binary name>
Done.

If you only need the 32-bit version, run R CMD INSTALL with --no-multiarch flag.
